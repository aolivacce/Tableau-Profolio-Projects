# Project 2: Tableau Focused Job Analysis 
This project was of particular interest to me as I am looking to pivot into the world of Data Science. Tableau is vital tool for managing and visualizing large datasets and is used vastly within the world of Data Science. For this case study, I analyzed trends in job opportunities, education requirements and salary expectations. Also, we will look into which job titles are the most tableau focused. I placed special emphasis on Data Engineers, Scientists, and Analysts as those field are most aligned with my career goals and experience!
